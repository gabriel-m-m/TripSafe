# TripSafe: Your Travel Companion

## What is TripSafe?

TripSafe is a women's travel safety app that offers location-based information for over 190 countries. It includes local emergency phone numbers for fire, ambulance and police services, as well as helplines addressing gender-based violence. It also provides information on levels of peace and women's safety in a user's area. This information is captured by 2 indices: [The Global Women Peace and Security Index](https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/) (WPS Index) and [The Global Peace Index](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/maps/#/) (GPI Index). 

The WPS Index scores and ranks 177 countries in terms of women's inclusion, justice, and security. It is published by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and the PRIO Centre on Gender, Peace and Security with support from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The index is based on 13 indicators of women's status classified under the three dimensions of inclusion, justice, and insecurity. 

The GPI Index covers 99.7% of the world's population, and is calculated using 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators from highly respected sources. It is produced by the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) which measures the relative position of nations' and regions' peacefulness.

#### *Libraries:*

All graphical interfaces were created using the SwiftUI library. The MapKit and Network libraries were used to integrate map elements and live user location information. TabularData was employed to parse country-specific index values and emergency numbers.

#### *Disclaimer:*

All travel safety data was compiled as of March 2024. Changes in global safety conditions, regulations, and other factors may affect data accuracy. TripSafe developers and providers shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, or injuries resulting from the use or misuse of the app.
