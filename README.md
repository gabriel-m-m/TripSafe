# TripSafe: Your Travel Companion

## What is TripSafe?

TripSafe is a travel safety app that offers location-based information for over 190 countries. It includes local emergency phone numbers for fire, ambulance and police services, as well as helplines addressing gender-based violence. It provides information regarding global peace and womens safety in a user's area. This information is captured by 2 indices: The Global Women Peace and Security Index (WPS Index) and The Global Peace Index. 

The WPS Index scores and ranks 177 countries in terms of women's inclusion, justice, and security. The WPS Index is published by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and the PRIO Centre on Gender, Peace and Security with support from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is based on 13 indicators of women's status classified under the three dimensions of inclusion, justice, and insecurity. 

The Global Peace Index covers 99.7% of the world's population, and is calculated using 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators from highly respected sources. It ist produced by the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) which measures the relative position of nations' and regions' peacefulness.
